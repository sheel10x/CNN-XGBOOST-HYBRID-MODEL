##  Overview
This project implements a state-of-the-art **Hybrid Medical Image Classification System** to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. 

Unlike standard deep learning approaches, this solution uses a **Fine-Tuned MobileNet (CNN)** as a powerful feature extractor and feeds those features into an **XGBoost Classifier**. This hybrid approach combines the spatial feature learning of CNNs with the gradient boosting power of XGBoost, achieving a remarkable **99.26% test accuracy**.

The model classifies MRI scans into four classes:
1.  **Glioma**
2.  **Meningioma**
3.  **Pituitary Tumor**
4.  **No Tumor**

##  Key Features
* **Hybrid Architecture:** MobileNetV2 backbone (with custom Swish activation) + XGBoost Classifier.
* **High Performance:** Outperforms standard CNN implementations with **99.26% Accuracy**.
* **Web Interface:** Includes a user-friendly **Streamlit** web app for instant predictions.
* **Advanced Preprocessing:** Uses Histogram Equalization and automated resizing.
* **Robust Metrics:** High Precision (99.27%) and Recall (99.26%) across all classes.
